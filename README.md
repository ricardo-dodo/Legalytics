# Legal Extraction API

### Project Overview:

Legal Extraction API is a powerful tool designed to extract structured information from legal documents using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. This API aims to streamline the process of analyzing and extracting key insights from legal documents, making it easier for legal professionals, researchers, and developers to access and utilize valuable information contained within legal texts.

### Key Features:

1. Text Extraction: The API can efficiently extract text from various types of legal documents, including contracts, court opinions, statutes, and more.
2. Entity Recognition: It employs advanced NLP algorithms to identify and extract entities such as parties, dates, locations, laws, and other relevant information from legal texts.
3. Key Term Extraction: The API identifies and extracts key terms and phrases that are significant within the context of the legal document, aiding in summarization and analysis.
4. Relationship Extraction: It can recognize relationships between entities, helping to understand the connections and dependencies within legal documents.
5. Scalability: The API is designed to be scalable, allowing for efficient processing of large volumes of legal documents.

### Usage:

Developers can integrate the Legal Extraction API into their applications, platforms, or workflows to automate the extraction and analysis of legal text. The API provides simple endpoints for text submission and returns structured data in a format that is easy to integrate with existing systems.
